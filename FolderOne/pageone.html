		<p class = "rightbar">President Donald Trump threatened on Friday to close the southern U.S. border with Mexico unless he gets the money he wants for a wall, raising the stakes in a standoff that will present an immediate test next week for the new U.S. Congress.</p>
		<p>Earlier this month, Trump said he would be “proud” to shut down the government over border security. But since the shutdown started, he has tried to blame Democrats. In television interviews on Friday, Trump aides said Democrats have refused to negotiate over the matter.</p>

	<p class = "rightbar">It was one of Donald Trump’s most-repeated campaign promises: Not only would he build a wall along the U.S. southern border – a “big, beautiful wall,” he boasted – he’d make Mexico pay for it. That was then.</p>
	<p>“Nobody builds walls better than me, believe me, and I’ll build them very inexpensively,” he told supporters during his campaign kickoff speech at Trump Tower on June 16, 2015. “I will build a great, great wall on our southern border. And I will have Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words.”</p>
	<p>As president, Trump demands that Congress give him $5 billion as a down payment on the wall and threatens to shut down the government if he doesn’t get it.</p>
	<p>Trump’s insistence that Congress give him $5 billion to help pay for the wall is a departure from his vow throughout the 2016 presidential campaign – and even into his presidency – that Mexico would bear the cost.</p>
